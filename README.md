### What's done in this project?

- Created a web-app based on a Machine Learning Algorithm that estimates the concentration of Air Quality Index PM 2.5 of Los Angeles, California. This could be useful for someone who is moving to Los Angeles and wants to find out about its air quality.

- Scraped climate data from 2010 to 2020 from three climate data websites using Python and Beautiful Soup. 

- Optimized Random Forest Regressor using RandomizedsearchCV to reach the best model.

**Libraries and frameworks**: Os, Time, Requests, Sys, Csv, Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Datetime, Missingno, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Scipy, Lazypreict, Lightgbm, Yellowbrick, Streamlit, Heroku
